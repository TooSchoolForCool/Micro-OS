# Micro-OS

Micro OS is a homemade small operating system which based on the JOS from [MIT 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/overview.html). Micro OS is developed for a standard x86-based personal computer and could be booted on most of virtual machines (e.g., Vmware, Virtual Box, QEMUâ€¦). For more details about my Micro OS, please move on and check later sections. 



## Installation Instructions & Requirements

For booting/running the Micro OS you need an x86 emulator (here I use **QEMU**), and a set of **compiler toolchain** to compiler the kernel source code. The compiler toolchain, including *assembler*, *linker*, *C compiler*, and *debugger*, could be easily installed on Linux (Ubuntu) or Mac OS. If you are a Windows user, I would highly recommend you use a virtual machine with Linux, otherwise please try to have [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) installed on your Windows. For Linux Ubuntu user please try `apt-get` to install these set of tools, and for Mac user please try [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to have these tools installed.
